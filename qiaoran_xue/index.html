                    <h2>who am i?</h2>
                    <p>i'm qiaoran. (she/her)</p>
                    <p>i used to spend my days working as a legal professional and am now back to school learning programming and all other fun computer stuff!</p>
                    <p>i love art, haruki murakami, 90's anime, exploring new restaurants and everything cute!</p>
                    <p>a couple of years ago, i became fascinated by how computers work and started to learn the basics of web development and programming. i was absorbed into the endlessly evolving and challenging nature of this industry and the impact that technology has on people's lives nowadays, and i want to engage in this world rather than just be a participant.</p>
                    <p>so i decieded it's time to make a career change!</p>
                    <p> i aspire to launch a successful career as a programmer and explore all the exciting new possibilities that come with it. also, i want to be someone who inspires young girls (like my daughter!) to become interested in technology.</p>
